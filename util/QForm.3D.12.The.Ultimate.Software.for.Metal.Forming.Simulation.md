If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need QForm 3D 12. QForm 3D 12 is the latest version of the QForm software, which is used by thousands of engineers and manufacturers worldwide for metal forming simulation. QForm 3D 12 is designed for cold, warm and hot die forging, open die forging, rolling, profile extrusion, hydroforming, cross-wedge rolling, cross-roll piercing and other metal forming processes. It can also simulate microstructure evolution, heat treatment, spring back and user-defined functions.
 
QForm 3D 12 has many features and benefits that make it the ultimate software for metal forming simulation. Here are some of them:
 
- It has the most user-friendly interface in the market, which allows you to easily prepare the initial data, run the simulation and view the results in one window.
- It has a fully automatic and highly adaptive mesh generator, which ensures accurate and reliable results without manual intervention.
- It has a fast and efficient solver, which uses modern programming techniques and multicore processors to speed up the simulation time.
- It has a wide range of special modules, such as microstructure prediction, heat treatment simulation, user subroutines assignment and others, which can be implemented in the program to enhance its functionality.
- It can simulate complex tools and workpieces, multiple workpieces of different materials, spring loaded tools and load holders, coupled thermo-mechanical problems and special boundary conditions.
- It can display the results in real time even while a complicated simulation is running, thanks to the separate but concurrent solver and user interface.
- It can export the results in various formats, such as DXF, IGES, STL, STEP and others, for further analysis or processing.

QForm 3D 12 is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is a proven and widely used technique for solving complex engineering problems. QForm 3D 12 uses FEM to model the material behavior, deformation, temperature distribution, stress and strain fields, tool wear and damage, microstructure evolution and other aspects of metal forming processes. QForm 3D 12 also uses FEM to optimize the process parameters, such as die geometry, billet shape and size, preform design, friction conditions, temperature profile and others.
 
QForm 3D 12 is compatible with SOLIDWORKS, which is a leading CAD software for design and engineering. You can import your SOLIDWORKS models into QForm 3D 12 or export your QForm 3D 12 results into SOLIDWORKS for further editing or visualization. QForm 3D 12 also supports other CAD formats, such as Parasolid, ACIS, CATIA, Inventor and others.
 
QForm 3D 12 is developed by QForm Group, which is a global company that specializes in metal forming simulation software. QForm Group has more than 25 years of experience in metal forming simulation and has offices in UK, USA, Germany, Russia, China, India and other countries. QForm Group provides technical support, training courses, online school, seminars, webinars, forums and other services to its customers.
